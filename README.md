# linear-regression-from-scratch
This is an implementation of linear regression using only numpy (and matplotlib to plot from main). <br>
This model uses gradient descent to train. <br>
This implementation is pretty bare bones, lacking some features such as regulaization and polynomial terms. <br>
If I add regularization, I will add it to this repo, and if I add polynomial functionality, I'll make a new repo for that. <br>

# Example 
If you don't want to run it yourself, here's an example of what you can expect. <br>
However, there is much more to show than this if you tweak the code such as parameters and data. <br>

# To Run
* Have a working python environment with recent versions of numpy and matplotlib
* Download this repo and navigate to it in terminal
* Run "python main.py"
